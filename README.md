### Link to article: https://www.wired.com/story/ai-helps-seismologists-predict-earthquakes/

I found this article particularly interesting because it utilises machine learning and AI to predict earthquakes. This is an amazing example of how software development can influence and eventually save lives. This demonstrates how we can apply incredible algorithms and software to help solve issues regarding weather patterns, especially as these extreme phenomena become more and more prevalent due to climate change. 

While we always must consider how to make a project or company profitable, it is also vital to consider how we apply these technologies, where to best apply these solutions, and to discern how this software can aid in other situations. This article illustrates the power of machine learning with a direct impact on human lives, and I only hope that this notion can be applied to other extreme conditions.
